# Games that can be adapted for remote play

## Tips

To adapt games for remote play:

1. use a camera to share publicly visible information (or hidden information before the game starts)
2. share pictures/scans of things players need to read as part of the game in advance
3. one person may need to move pieces on behalf of the other players and read out information
4. players may need to keep track of additional information themselves (e.g. on paper)
5. label grids to make it easier for remote players to call out where they want to play
