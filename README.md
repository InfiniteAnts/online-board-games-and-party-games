# Online board games and party games
A list of games that can be played online with a group of friends.

## Voice chat suggestions
Many of these games assume you are using a seperate tool to chat. Here are some free tools you can use:

- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - multiple text/voice channels that you can join and leave at any time
- [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) - a temporary video meeting with a shareable link, no need to install anything, but requires a google account to set up
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) - a temporary video meeting, easy for other people to join without signing up, but you may need to restart the call every 40 minutes
